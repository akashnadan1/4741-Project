Our goal is analyze NBA player data and identify the best situations for taking a shot. We plan on answering the following questions:

    -Whether or not a player will make their shot based on their current situation (distance from the hoop, game period, distance from defender, etc.)
    
    -What are the optimal characteristics for making a shot
